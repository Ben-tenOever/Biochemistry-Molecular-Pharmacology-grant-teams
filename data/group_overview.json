  "overview": "Biochemistry and Molecular Pharmacology brings together 8 investigators working across proteomics, multi-omics integration, proteogenomics, machine learning, deep learning. Collectively, the group spans strengths in microscopy, rna, mass, spectrometry, structural. This site provides within-group pair and multi-investigator team suggestions derived only from the group roster to keep matches in scope.",
