  "lab_synopsis": "Our laboratory is interested in how ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis controls the three key dimensions of cellular life:  proliferation, survival, and differentiation.  Specifically, we aim at dissecting the biochemical and molecular mechanisms behind fundamental cellular processes that, when deregulated, result in cancer.  We use an interdisciplinary approach to test new hypotheses and biological concepts. The remarkable processivity of the Ubiquitin-Proteasome System (UPS) enables it to very rapidly eliminate protein substrates.  This is achieved by utilizing more than 600 effectors (i.e., the ubiquitin ligases) rendering the whole system an exquisite example of biochemical specificity.  In this regard, the ca. 230 members of the CRL (Cullin-RING-ubiquitin Ligase) family represent an extraordinary machinery of protein destruction, which unidirectionally controls the cellular abundance of regulatory proteins both temporally and spatially.  Moreover, its control over a wide array of substrates renders the CRL machinery a central node in the regulation of cellular homeostasis. Our lab was among the first to establish that the cell cycle is regulated by the UPS. Our early research revealed that the levels of the cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor p27 oscillate throughout the cell cycle due to differential ubiquitylation and degradation. We later discovered that the degradation of p27 and its paralog p21 is orchestrated by the CRL1-SKP2 complex and its cofactor CKS1. Building on these findings, we elucidated the pivotal role of additional CRLs in the precise spatiotemporal regulation of core cell-cycle components and their upstream regulators. We demonstrated that a dynamic degradation cycle driven by CRLs dictates the tempo of cell-cycle progression by modulating distinct elements of the CDK regulatory network within defined time windows. Furthermore, we uncovered how CRLs establish a direct mechanistic link between DNA replication, centrosome duplication, and cell division, ensuring faithful cell-cycle progression. Expanding our research beyond the cell cycle, we revealed that the CRL family serves as a master regulator, coordinating multiple, seemingly disparate cellular processes, including protein synthesis, ribosomal biogenesis, apoptosis, DNA-damage checkpoints, and circadian rhythms. Our studies in mouse models illuminated how dysregulation of CRLs and their downstream networks drives malignant transformation and how it can be targeted with novel therapeutic strategies. Additionally, we explored the role of CRLs in metastatic progression and demonstrated that aberrant protein degradation is a hallmark of human cancers and frequently serves as a prognostic marker. In summary, much research in my laboratory has arisen from the paradigm of the timed regulation of the mammalian cell division cycle by the UPS that I established a number of years ago.  Today we have expanded our focus to five main areas: (i) cell signaling, (ii) cell cycle regulation, (iii) the DNA damage response, (iv) oncology, and (v) drug discovery.",
