  "lab_synopsis": "The ongoing theme of my work is the invention or adaptation of advanced chromatography and mass spectrometry technology to tackle challenging analytical problems with a translational potential. Methodologically, much of my science is designed around using high throughput LC-MS as the analytical readout of biochemical experiments. Biologically, my efforts have grown from studying targeted metabolic pathways in drug metabolism, to global metabolic profiling in a variety of disease states. I learned about the power of this approach in my graduate studies which examined the metabolic pathways of the widely used anticoagulant drug, warfarin. Many biological hypotheses had been overlooked in the field because of the analytical challenge of separating and quantifying the diverse array of its metabolites called hydroxywarfarins. To address this challenge, I ultimately invented and patented a new chromatographic technology which enabled us to analyze clinical samples with unprecedented completeness. This led to the discovery of an unexpected feedback inhibition mechanism which partly explains the high-degree of interpersonal variation in drug-response beyond what pharmacogenetic studies can explain. From this example, I expanded my efforts to large-scale metabolomics experiments, with the focus of improving the confidence of metabolite annotations from global experiments, a similar bottleneck in our ability to advance scientific understanding and test metabolic hypotheses. I developed a stable isotope labeling method which can solve the chemical formula of an unknown metabolite de novo. I designed software to automate the analysis of such data and introduced the first false-discovery control method for compound identification in metabolomics. My long-term direction is to continue developing metabolomics data analysis tools which make it easier for investigators to apply metabolomics technology to their own research. I have been applying these tools and others to many collaborative research projects within the scope of my role as Director of the NYU Metabolomics Core Resource laboratory and in my own independent research within my appointment as an Assistant Professor on diverse topics related to development of data analysis tools for metabolomics informatics and human exposures and response to environmental toxicants.",
