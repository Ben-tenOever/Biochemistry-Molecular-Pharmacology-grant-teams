My focus is the analysis of analytical measurements: the estimation of the information content of these measurements from different experimental designs, and the optimal use of such information to yield statistically meaningful answers to biological questions. I apply these computational methods to solve practical problems in experimental design optimization and quantitative data analysis. A large portion of my work has been on proteomic data analysis: I established a statistical basis for testing the significance of protein identification results, developed computational methods and databases for protein identification, quantitation and characterization of post-translational modifications and interaction, and applied machine learning to build predictive models. I am currently focusing on developing methods for integrating multi-modal data\u2014including multi-omics, imaging and text data\u2014 which have provided a wide array of powerful tools for discovery and verify biomarkers and therapeutic targets in cancer. I am applying multi-omics approaches to better understand tumor biology with a focus on improving patient treatment.",
