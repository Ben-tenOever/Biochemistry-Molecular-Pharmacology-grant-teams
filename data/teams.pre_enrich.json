My research focuses on the study of the Long Interspersed Element-1 (LINE-1 or L1) retrotransposon, which is the only TE capable of autonomously \"jumping\" within the human genome.; Pau Castel: The Castel laboratory is interested in understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying oncoprotein-mediated transformation. Our laboratory uses biochemical, cell signaling, mouse modeling, and pharmacological approaches to elucidate the functions and regulation of different oncoproteins in cancer and congenital disorders.; Michele Pagano: Our laboratory is interested in how ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis controls the three key dimensions of cellular life:  proliferation, survival, and differentiation.

My focus is the analysis of analytical measurements: the estimation of the information content of these measurements from different experimental designs, and the optimal use of such information to yield statistically meaningful answers to biological questions.; Gregory David: The research conducted in our laboratory centers on the interplay between aging and cancer.

    "synopsis": "This application would address Development of Psychosocial Therapeutic and Preventive Interventions for Mental Disorders (R61/R33 Clinical Trial Required) by integrating complementary expertise across the team. The proposed collaboration is centered on research, novel, therapeutic, studies and is designed to produce a cohesive, milestone-driven set of deliverables.",
    "rationale_detailed": "Faculty were selected for strong topical overlap with the opportunity and complementary, non-redundant strengths. Key contributions: Michele Pagano: Our laboratory is interested in how ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis controls the three key dimensions of cellular life:  proliferation, survival, and differentiation. Specifically, we aim at dissecting the biochemical and molecular mechanisms behind fundamental cellular processes that, when deregulated, result in cancer.; Pau Castel: The Castel laboratory is interested in understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying oncoprotein-mediated transformation. Our laboratory uses biochemical, cell signaling, mouse modeling, and pharmacological approaches to elucidate the functions and regulation of different oncoproteins in cancer and congenital disorders.; Nadav Brandes: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized Artificial intelligence (AI). Despite being originally designed for text, these models turn out to be incredibly effective for biological sequences like DNA and proteins.; Paolo Mita: Transposable elements (TE) are sequences of DNA that are capable of moving within a host genome, and thus are often referred to as “jumping genes.” DNA transposons use a “cut and paste” mechanism to move within a host genome while retrotransposons increase their amount using a “copy and paste” process. My research focuses on the study of the Long Interspersed Element-1 (LINE-1 or L1) retrotransposon, which is the only TE capable of autonomously \"jumping\" within the human genome..",
    "suggested_aims": [
      "Aim 1: Define and quantify the core problem space in research, novel, therapeutic, studies using the team’s established models and datasets.",
      "Aim 2: Develop and optimize an integrated approach that leverages each investigator’s strengths to address the opportunity requirements.",
      "Aim 3: Validate outcomes in the most relevant system and deliver a clear translational or mechanistic endpoint aligned to the FOA."
